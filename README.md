# Sunspot Time Series Project
A repository comprising of a Jupyter notebook containing some work on extracting information from a time-series for sunspot activity from 1749-1983. The project is self-driven is really just meant for me to practice my data analysis and digital signal processing knowledge and skills I learnt from my undergraduate thesis and advanced signal processing courses I learnt in a 4th year DSP elective course.

Will be updating this repo come time when I am interested in applying new DSP techniques I learn along the way to extract new information from the sunspot time-series data.

I'm more or less using this as training grounds for exploring new techniques. Perhaps might slide in some machine learning later on...
